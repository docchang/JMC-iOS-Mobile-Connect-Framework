JMC-Mobile-Connect-framework
============================
This project encapsulate the jiraconnect-ios into a framework and resource bundle. This should save you time because now you can...

* Include the framework in a ARC enabled project without doing -fno-objc-arc
* Include the resource in one step, without find and select all the resource files.
* Feel good about your project, because it is nice and cleanâ€¦

The original source is here: https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/jiraconnect-ios/overview, but  I wouldn't bother downloading it.
